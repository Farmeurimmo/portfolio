# My V4 Portfolio (Svelte+Vite+TailwindCSS)

This is the fourth iteration of my portfolio site. It's built with Svelte and Tailwind CSS.

## Developing

You need to have Node.js >= 16 installed on your machine.

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a
development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev --open
```
