# My V4 Portfolio (Svelte)

This is the fourth iteration of my portfolio site.
It is currently in early development and is not yet ready for production.
See how it looks at [https://v4.farmeurimmo.fr/](https://v4.farmeurimmo.fr/).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a
development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```
